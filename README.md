Comparative Analysis of Users on Twitter to Assess Some Indicators of Social Tension

This project assessed the similarities and differences in social tension on the basis of the key words "immigration", "metoo" and "LGBTQ". I extracted information from twitter, first through the users in US, then India and then worldwide to compare the differences in sentiment using python. The code attached, is the sentiment analysis that was used for the project.
